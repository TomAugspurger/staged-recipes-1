## Getting started

1. Fork this repository.
2. Make a new folder in `recipes` for your dataset. Look at the example recipe and pipeline for help.
3. Open a pull request.
4. When your pull request is merged, a new repository, called a feedstock, will be created in the Pangeo-Forge GitHub organization, and build/publishing of your dataset will automatically be triggered. Once complete, the dataset will be available in Pangeo-Forge's data catalog.
